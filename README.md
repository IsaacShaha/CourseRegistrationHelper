# CourseRegistrationHelper
A series of programs I've created to help myself with course registration at UVic. This was created in Python 3 using Windows.

# Virtual Environment Setup
I used pip and virtualenv to create an environment with selenium installed. I used the following commands in the main folder:
- virtualenv WebScrapingEnvironment
- WebScrapingEnvironment\scripts\activate
- pip install selenium
